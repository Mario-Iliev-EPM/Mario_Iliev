This is a web ui testing automation project for  https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/
I used specFlow 3.9.74 and Selenium Webdriver 4.7.0 for my framework and Nunit as testing framework.
My solution is separated on two projects WebUI.TestFramework for Page Objects and contexts and WebUITests for the feature files and step defenitions.
I use WebDriver Manager to keep my Chrome driver up to date automatically
Also I have added Allure 3.5.0.73 for reporting
